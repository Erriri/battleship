A game of battleship made in python, using tkinter and the model-view-controller pattern

why did I use tkinter? why did I use model-view-controller? idk, just felt silly

wanted to get some practice with this stuff

obv this is just against a bot, multiplayer would be way beyond the scope of this


since apparently there are different sets of rules for battleship, this is what I've used here:

-Each player places one 4-long ship, two 3-long ships, three 2-long ships, and four 1-long ships on a 10x10 grid

-Ships can't touch (including diagonals) nor overlap

-Players take turns shooting the enemy grid, ending their turn if they hit a blank space

-When a ship is sunk, it is called out, so that the enemy can place the marks for the ship border

or something like that
